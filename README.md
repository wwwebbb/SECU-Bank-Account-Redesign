# SECU-Bank-Account-Redesign
The current SECU bank account desktop webpage UI/UX has been outdated for many years now, 
so I decided to redesign it to look and function more like a combination of the [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/secu/id1435916976) 
and [home desktop website](https://www.ncsecu.org/) without copying code- 
It includes mobile compatibility with Bootstrap and jQuery implementation. 

It should be noted that both the full account website and mobile version of the account website are options listed on the [login page through 
a mobile web browser](https://www.ncsecu.org/Home/MobileSignIn.html), however the mobile version is not styled yet lists about the same amount 
of information as the mobile app. If my design were to be implemented, it would remove the need for two different login options while keeping
the style consistent with any screen size.
